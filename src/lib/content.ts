    title: 'Uniqueness in All Aspects',
    description:
      'We do not build what already exists. Before any project moves forward, we ask one question: has anyone made something that feels exactly like this? If the answer is yes, we go deeper. Originality is not a goal we aim for — it is a standard we hold from day one.',
